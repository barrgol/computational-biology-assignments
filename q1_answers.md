#### a)

Michaelis constant $K_m$ is the substrate concentration level $[S]$ at which reaction rate is equal to $50 \%$ of the maximum: $v = \frac{V_{\max}}{2}$.

$V_{\max}$ is the maximum (limiting) reaction rate of a system when the substrate concentration approaches $\infin$ (saturation).

#### b)

The enzymes in the system appear as either free enzymes $\text{E}$ or are bound in enzyme-substrate complexes $\text{ES}$. The total amount of enzyme in the system is thus:

$$ \text{E}_{\text{total}} = [\text{E}] + [\text{ES}] $$

Since the rate of the catalytic reaction is given as

$$ v = k_{cat} [\text{ES}] $$, the maximal rate for fixed $\text{E}_{\text{total}}$ is achieved when all enzymes in the system are bound in enzyme-substrate complexes:

$$ [\text{E}] = 0 $$

$$ \text{E}_{\text{total}} = [\text{ES}] $$

$$ V_{\max} = k_{cat} \text{E}_{\text{total}} $$

#### c)

In this highly unlikely case, the assumption fails. The $V_{\max} = k_{cat} \text{E}_{\text{total}}$ assumption is strongly based on the $[S] \gg [E]$. In the "$v$ vs $[S]$ plot", as $[S]$ approaches infinity, the **saturation** starts to occur - all existing enzymes bind with the substrates, forming ES complex. At some (hypothetical) point there is no more enzymes left to interact with substract to produce ES. The maximum rate $V_{\max}$ is thus restriscted by the total amount of enzymes $E_{total}$. This statement wouldn't be true if $[S] \gg [E]$.

#### g)

Maximal reaction rate $V_{\max} = E_{total} k_{cat} $ would become twice as big.

Michaelis constant $K_m = \frac{k_{-} + k_{cat}}{k_{+}}$, dependent only on kinetic rate constants, would remain the same.
